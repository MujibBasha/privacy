MAANHAJI Founded in 2020 by Mujib Fathi Basha, MANHAJI has come a long way from its beginnings in a  student's room.
When MANHAJI first started as idea, From the suffering and problems of this student and other students at the university level,
as a result of the weakness of the educational process and the lack of learning resources, Which was the basic seed in the rise of Manhaji

I got a lot of help from my friends Mohammed Alnajm ,Mahmoud Alghoul ,Nada Ganoun ,
Omar Emdakem to finish MANHAJI and are thrilled to be a part of this community.
